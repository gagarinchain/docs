We developed block explorer to allow users to monitor end explore Gagarin blockchain. Block explorer is react.js single page application which is deliverred in Docker container.

Explorer container should be run in the same network where node is run, since explorer connects to node through WebSocket on container 9180 port.

## Functions
- Real time blockchain progress
- Block search by hash
